The API functions i added are quite simple, i wanted to add some image altering ones but every api uses different kind of classes n stuff so i got bored, also theres `Jayx` and `NotSoBot` for advanced image altering. I added a prodia api command that uses the prodia stable diffusion model, allowing you to generate images based on a given prompt. 

Here are the functions i added:

- **!h**: Lists all the commands, do not confuse it with !help;
- **!ai (string)**: Generates an image based on your prompt (Prodia ai api), [API](https://app.prodia.com/api)
- **!dog**: Gives u a random dog image, [API](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random)  <!-- <img align="center" src="https://github.com/Hue-Jhan/Discord-Free-API-Bot/blob/main/media/apibot%20dog.png" width="100" /> -->
